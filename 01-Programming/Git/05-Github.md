# Github Notes

### Pull request
A pull request (PR) is a mechanism for proposing changes from one branch (usually a feature or fix branch) into another (often the main or development branch) within a Git repository.

### Generic Github workflow
1. Clone Repository
2. Create new branch from `main` or another branch
3. Make your changes
4. Push the branch into the remote repository
5. Open pull request
6. Merge the changes
7. Pull the merged changes into your local `main` branch
8. Repeat from step 2
